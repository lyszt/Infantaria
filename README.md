# INFANTARIA: Regressus Regis 

The game is named after the first game I made when I was 12 years old in Unity 3D.
And hopefully it will be better than the one I made back then. (Not to say it will be good.)

### Motives
The project is mainly done for OPENGL learning. 
My source of study is a book.
